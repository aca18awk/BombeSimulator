# BombeSimulator
Code written as the extended solution to one of the Functional Programming assignments.

### Bombe
This file contains the code for the recommended design we needed to implement

### ExtendedBombe
This file contains the code which solves Enigma in the similar runtime but with the much higher percentage correctness.

Note: The simulator works assuming that the choice of rotors was always the same (Rotor1, Rotor2, Rotor3) and that ReflectorB was the reflector which was used. This assumption was one of the specification of the assignment. However, it can be very easily removed.
